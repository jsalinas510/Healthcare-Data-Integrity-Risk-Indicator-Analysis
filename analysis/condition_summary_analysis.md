# Condition-Level Utilization and Outcome Analysis

## Analysis Objective
To evaluate how patient conditions (diagnosis proxy) relate to healthcare utilization, readmissions, and outcomes.

---

## Metrics Used
The following metrics were calculated by condition:
- Number of patient encounters
- Average cost
- Average length of stay
- Readmission rate
- Average satisfaction score

---

## Summary Table (Example Structure)

| Condition | Encounters | Avg Cost | Avg Length of Stay | Readmission Rate | Avg Satisfaction |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Example Condition | XX | $X,XXX | X.X days | XX% | X.X |

---

## Key Findings
- Certain conditions are associated with higher average costs and longer lengths of stay.
- Readmission rates vary across conditions, indicating differences in patient risk and care complexity.
- Conditions with higher utilization often correspond to lower patient satisfaction scores.

---

## Healthcare Relevance
Condition-level analysis supports:
- Identification of high-utilization and high-risk patient groups
- More accurate risk stratification
- Improved healthcare reporting and decision-making
