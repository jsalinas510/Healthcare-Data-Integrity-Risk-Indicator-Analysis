# Initial Data Review

## Dataset Structure
The dataset contains the following fields:

- Patient_ID: Unique patient identifier
- Age: Patient age in years
- Gender: Patient gender
- Condition: Diagnosis proxy
- Procedure: Procedure performed during encounter
- Cost: Total encounter cost
- Length_of_Stay: Hospital stay duration
- Readmission: Indicator of patient readmission
- Outcome: Encounter outcome
- Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction score

## Documentation Completeness Check

Condition data was reviewed to assess documentation completeness.

Findings:
- Some encounters contained missing or unspecified condition values.
- Missing condition data limits the ability to assess patient risk and utilization patterns.

## Age Validation

Age values were reviewed to ensure reasonable ranges.

Findings:
- Most age values fell within expected adult ranges.
- Any ages outside plausible ranges were flagged for exclusion or further review.

## Readmission and Outcome Consistency

Readmission and outcome fields were reviewed for consistency.

Findings:
- Readmission values were standardized to Yes/No.
- Outcome categories were reviewed to ensure consistent labeling.
- Inconsistent values were cleaned to support accurate reporting.

## Summary Observations

- Documentation completeness varies across encounters, particularly for condition data.
- Data standardization is necessary before risk or outcome analysis.
- These data quality checks are essential for reliable healthcare reporting and risk assessment.
