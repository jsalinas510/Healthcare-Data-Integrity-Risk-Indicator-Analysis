# Healthcare Data Integrity & Risk Indicator Analysis

## Project Overview
Healthcare organizations rely on accurate clinical encounter data to assess patient risk, monitor outcomes, and support reporting and reimbursement processes. Incomplete or inconsistent documentation can limit effective analysis and decision-making.

This project analyzes patient encounter data to evaluate documentation completeness, identify high-risk patient patterns, and examine relationships between risk indicators, utilization, outcomes, and patient satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient-level encounter information, including:
- Demographics (Age, Gender)
- Clinical indicators (Condition, Procedure)
- Utilization metrics (Cost, Length of Stay)
- Outcome indicators (Readmission, Outcome, Satisfaction)

The data is synthetic and used solely for educational and portfolio purposes.

## Project Goals
- Assess documentation completeness using condition-level data
- Identify high-risk patient patterns
- Analyze utilization, outcomes, and satisfaction trends
- Create clear, business-focused healthcare reporting
